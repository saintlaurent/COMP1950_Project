        <h2>FULL TIME PROGRAMS<br />
        </h2>
        <p>When accepted into a full-time program, you are automatically registered into all the courses you need for program completion. You will be assigned to a set — that is, a group of 16-24 students who take all their classes together for an entire semester or a whole year.</p>
        <p>Expect to be with your set for 5 to 7 hours a day, five days a week, starting as early as 7 a.m. but usually ending before 5 p.m. Half your study hours will be spent in the classroom. The rest of your time will be used for hands-on training in a lab, shop or real-world situation, practicing the skills you'll need when you enter the workforce. You'll work in groups of two to 10 on practical projects which will help you develop outstanding teamwork, interpersonal and communication skills. Student projects are often sponsored by companies in business and industry.</p>
        <p>Apprenticeship training is a form of learning that consists of on the job training, work experience and formal classroom technical training. It is a full-time commitment, 80% of which is paid on-the-job work experience and 20% technical training at BCIT in one of 30 trades.</p>
        <p>Cooperative education is available for many full-time programs. By participating in co-op, you get paid work experience in your field while completing your studies. It involves alternating between going to school at BCIT and paid work placements, all of which count as credit towards your program completion. </p>
