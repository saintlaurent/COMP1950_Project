        <h2>Here's what you can expect.<br />
        </h2>
        <p class="grey">Your instructor will know you by name and there will be plenty of time to get one-on-one help with your course work.</p>
        <p> You'll also start your program and graduate with the same classmates, forging relationships that will last throughout your career. Plus you'll have more opportunity to get your hands on the latest equipment!</p>
        <p>Did you know? 75% of classrooms across all BCIT campuses have a capacity of 30 seats or less.        <img src="images/about_img.jpg" alt="picture" width="239" height="240" class="work" />        </p>
        <p><em>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. </em></p>
        <p>The best way to learn something is by actually doing it. Yes, you will have lectures and textbooks, but most of your time will be spent directly applying what you've learned in a lab, shop, classroom, or practicum.
Being connected<br />

          Where does it come from?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Learning by doing</h3>
        <p>BCIT programs are developed in consultation with leading employers. Advisory committees provide direct input to curriculum development to ensure that you'll be at the forefront of the latest developments in your industry. BCIT instructors are active in their careers and bring years of practical expertise. They bring an insider's perspective of their industry–knowledge and experience that will benefit you in the classroom and after you graduate.</p>
        <h3>Small class sizes</h3>
        <p>And that's only part of the journey. Once you're here, we offer many services and activities to help you succeed and get the most out of your experience.

There are a host of student services, recreation services, and clubs and organizations that make BCIT a vibrant community. </p>

        <h2>Students saying</h2>
        <p><em>&quot;Education is like a double-edged sword. It may be turned to dangerous uses if it is not properly handled&quot;</em></p>

        <p><em>“One learns how to teach and get better at it by actually teaching, analyzing results, and using feedback to improve. Teacher education programs do not teach people how to teach; at best, they prepare students to learn the needed professional skills once they begin teaching.&quot;</em></p>
